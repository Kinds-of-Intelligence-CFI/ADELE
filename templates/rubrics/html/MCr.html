      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        This rubric assesses the difficulty of the metacognitive processing required by the respondent to identify the information necessary during the process of solving the task with a given set of information. More concretely, it involves the respondent&#x27;s ability to recognize what information helps solve the task or does not, and how this recognition process unfolds as they work toward the solution.

            <strong>None.</strong> All necessary information is immediately apparent and directly applicable to solving the task, or no information is provided and none is needed. No metacognitive processing is required to identify relevant information during problem-solving. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;What is 2513441 + 7519239519281?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;How many sports correspond to IPTC Newscode mediatopic/20000960?.&quot;</span></li>

            <li data-label="Level 1">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Very low.</strong> Most relevant information is readily identifiable, with minimal extraneous details. The respondent needs to do simple filtering or selection of information as they proceed with solving the task, but the relevance of information remains clear throughout the process. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <li data-label="Level 2">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Low.</strong> A fair amount of potentially relevant information is provided, mixed with some irrelevant details. As the respondent works through the problem, they need to evaluate which pieces of information are useful for the next step in their solution process, requiring ongoing but straightforward metacognitive assessment. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;Sarah went to the grocery store on Tuesday. She bought 3 oranges for $0.50 each, 2 apples for $0.75 each, and a loaf of bread for $2.25. What was the total cost of the fruit Sarah purchased?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;In preparation for a marathon, James ran 5 miles on Monday, 8 miles on Wednesday, and 6 miles on Saturday. He also trained at the gym for 2 hours each week. How many miles did James run in total?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;Mary took photos of the Colosseum at sunset and visited the Vatican Museums where she spent two hours studying the famous ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. She also bought souvenirs for her friends and got lost trying to find her hotel. What did Mary observe at the Vatican Museums?&quot;</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <li data-label="Level 3">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Medium.</strong> The respondent must engage in moderate metacognitive processing throughout the problem-solving process in one or both of these ways: (1) evaluating and reconciling potentially conflicting or redundant information that serves as distractors within a manageable search space, or (2) recognizing what additional information or problem-solving approaches are needed when not all relevant information is explicitly provided, but the possible solution paths remain relatively constrained. Some information that seems irrelevant initially may become important later, or some unstated information may become crucial to identify as the solution progresses. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;A student&#x27;s short essay discusses how Shakespeare&#x27;s character Hamlet shows signs of depression. In the essay, it states that Hamlet speaks harshly to Ophelia in Act 3, telling her &#x27;Get thee to a nunnery&#x27; and refusing her love. The essay also mentions his soliloquy &#x27;To be or not to be,&#x27; his wearing of dark clothes at court, and his Act 1 conversation with Horatio about his father&#x27;s ghost. The essay is 1000 words long and includes quotes from Acts 1, 3, and 5. What evidence does the essay present about Hamlet&#x27;s interactions with Ophelia?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;A news article discusses a local park renovation project, mentioning the park&#x27;s historical significance from the 1950s, current visitor numbers, planned new features including a playground and walking paths, the project&#x27;s $500,000 budget split across different improvements, debates about preserving old trees versus adding parking spaces, and quotes from both the project manager and local residents about their memories of childhood visits. What are the specific new features planned for the park renovation?&quot;</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <li data-label="Level 4">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>High.</strong> The problem-solving process requires sophisticated metacognitive strategies throughout, with a large search space to navigate. This could involve either: (1) evaluating multiple possible interpretations of significant amounts of conflicting/redundant information that serves as distractors, requiring exploration of various combination possibilities, or (2) identifying crucial unstated information or approaches needed for solution while considering multiple possible solution paths and their implications. The respondent must frequently reassess their understanding and adjust their approach as they either discover new connections between provided information or recognize important unstated elements needed for solving the task. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;In this escape room scenario, you find a desk with a locked drawer, a calendar marked with different colored circles, a bookshelf with titles in various languages, and a wall clock showing 3:45. On the desk, there&#x27;s a note that reads &#x27;Time reveals knowledge, knowledge unlocks secrets.&#x27; A painting on the wall shows a sunset over a library, and there&#x27;s a globe with certain cities marked with stars. Each time you examine an object, you notice new details that might connect to others. How can you open the locked drawer?&quot;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">“Assume that there exist only two types of people: knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, while knaves always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 6 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a knight and who is a knave.\nA: E is a liar if and only if C is a liar.\nB: If D is a liar, then E is a liar.\nC: E is a truth-teller and F is a truth-teller.\nD: C is a liar if and only if B is a liar.\nE: If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\nF: B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.”</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&quot;A customer survey about a new phone model gathered feedback through three methods: online reviews mentioned battery life lasting &#x27;all day&#x27;, &#x27;about 12 hours&#x27;, or &#x27;14-16 hours&#x27;; in-person interviews reported battery performance as &#x27;excellent&#x27;, &#x27;better than previous model by 4 hours&#x27;, or &#x27;lasting from morning to night&#x27;; and usage data showed power consumption patterns varying between 10-18 hours depending on features used. Technical specs list battery capacity, screen brightness impact, and various power-saving modes. What can be concluded about the phone&#x27;s actual battery life?&quot;</span></li>
                    </ul>

            <li data-label="Level 5+">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Very high.</strong> The problem-solving process demands constant high-level metacognitive monitoring and regulation in challenging conditions: either most of the provided information is redundant, misleading, or contradictory (while remaining solvable), or crucial information about solution approaches and constraints is left unstated and must be discovered. The respondent must maintain awareness of many possible interpretation frameworks or solution paths simultaneously, regularly revisiting their understanding as they either recontextualize conflicting information or identify necessary unstated information and constraints. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Riddles such as: &quot;I am found in ancient scrolls and modern screens, made of nothing but seen by all, I dance between light and dark, born in storms yet living in peace, flowing like water but dry as sand, silent as night but telling stories, changing shape with every eye yet always staying the same. Sometimes I march in straight lines, other times I curl and twist, I can be bold or gentle, thick or thin, but I never truly exist. What am I?&quot; (the answer is &quot;shadow&quot;)</span></li>
