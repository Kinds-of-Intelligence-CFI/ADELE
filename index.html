                This is a collaborative community, initiated by researchers at the <a href="https://www.lcfi.ac.uk/">Leverhulme
                Centre for the Future of Intelligence</a>,
                University of Cambridge, for the use and extension of ADeLe v1.0, a battery for explanatory and
                predictive LLM
                evaluation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The ADeLe (<u>An</u>notated-<u>De</u>mand-<u>Le</u>vels) battery includes 63 tasks from 20 benchmarks
                and was introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378">the original paper</a>. Those tasks
                where
                annotated using 18 rubrics for <u>De</u>mand-<u>Le</u>vel-<u>An</u>notation (DeLeAn v1.0) of general
                scales.
                <br>
                <br>
                ADeLe allows to obtain ability profile explaining what LLMs can do. At the same time, ADeLe can be
                extended by applying the DeLeAn rubric to new benchmarks and thus understanding what they really
                measure. The figure below (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378">the original paper</a>) shows
                this process.

                        to LLMs, and add subdimensions (leading to 11).
                        It also includes domain ‘knowledge’ (with 5 subdimensions) and 2 ‘extraneous’ dimensions:
                        Atypicality and Volume,
                        to account for elements that make the task more challenging independently of primordial or
                        knowledge demands.
                        An additional dimension, Unguessability, is computed algorithmically by considering the number
                        of choices, instead of using a rubric.

        This criterion assesses the level of attention and scan required to focus on or locate specific elements within a given stream of information or environment in the whole process of solving a task. During this process, there is the need to actively scan for or retrieve elements that meet predetermined criteria. The level represents the extent to which the task requires locating and focusing on specific target information, ranging from situations where the target is immediately obvious to those requiring sustained tracking of multiple targets among numerous distractors—any elements that are irrelevant to solve the task, such as visual objects, sounds, pieces of text, noise, or other stimuli, but compete for attention with the target information—in complex, dynamic environments. The challenge is not on determining what to look for but focusing the attention to find it within a larger context. This differs from tasks where there&#x27;s a need to identify which pieces of information are relevant from a set already under consideration. While both processes may overlap in complex tasks like reading comprehension or image understanding, “attention and scan” specifically focuses on the deployment of attention during scan processes when solving the task, rather than the selection or evaluation of information.

        This rubric evaluates the difficulty of a task&#x27;s comprehension requirements, encompassing the understanding of text, stories or the semantic content of other representations of ideas in different formats or modalities. It may include the interpretation of explicit and implicit meanings, recognition of relationships between concepts, processing of contextual information, and understanding of abstract ideas and complex systems. Noteworthy, the mere presence of specialized terminology or jargon does not necessarily indicate a high difficulty level in this rubric, as these terms may appear within tasks that follow simple, straightforward linguistic structures and are more reflective of domain knowledge rather than comprehension complexity. Further, for specialized formal languages (e.g., molecular structures, programming code) the task will be hard to comprehend only if the sequence in that formal language (e.g. molecular expression, snippet of code) is convoluted, but simple molecules or pieces of code should be easy. The rubric include difficult levels that range from tasks requiring no semantic comprehension to those demanding an understanding of highly convoluted, interconnected concepts, including the ability to process sophisticated theoretical frameworks, understand nuanced implications, and synthesize multiple complex perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.

                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Comprehending a modernist novel that uses a stream-of-consciousness narrative technique where multiple timelines, memories, and internal thoughts are interwoven without clear demarcation, requiring readers to track subtle linguistic shifts (changes in tense, pronouns, or narrative voice) to understand when the narrative moves between present action, past memories, imagined futures, and other characters&#x27; perspectives.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Understanding a convoluted visual narrative where multiple story threads are told simultaneously through different visual styles on the same page, requiring understanding of how the visual elements interact, conflict, and complement each other to create meaning.

        This rubric evaluates the difficulty of a task&#x27;s expression requirements, encompassing the generation and articulation of ideas, stories, or semantic content in different formats or modalities. It may include the usage  of the right vocabulary, adoption of the appropriate genre, formulation of explicit and implicit meanings, creation of relationships between concepts, incorporation of contextual information, expression of abstract ideas and complex systems, and transformation of sophisticated content into a smooth narrative. Noteworthy, the need of specialized vocabulary or jargon in the expression does not necessarily indicate a high level of difficulty, as these terms may be used within simple, straightforward linguistic structures requiring minimal compositional complexity and are more reflective of domain knowledge rather than expression sophistication. In addition, the difficulty level should correspond to the simplest expression effort to successfully solve the task, given that a solution to a task may be formulated in various ways with varied linguistic complexity; multiple-choice questions, even if the options are long and complex, generally do not require language expression beyond the basic level, so they are typically level 1. The rubric ranges from tasks requiring no meaningful expression to those demanding the generation of highly sophisticated, interconnected content, including the ability to create convoluted narratives, convey nuanced implications, and express multiple perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.

        This rubric assesses the difficulty level of tasks requiring conceptualization, learning, and abstraction during the completion of tasks. It evaluates the extent to which a task necessitates the formation of new concepts, engagement in inductive and analogical reasoning, mapping of relationships between domains, and the generation of abstractions from concrete examples. Higher levels on this scale represent increasing demands for real-time learning, pattern identification, hypothesis formation, analogical transfer, and the contrast of knowledge across diverse domains.

            <strong>None.</strong> The task requires no conceptualization, learning, abstraction, inductive or analogical reasoning. It involves applying well-established procedures or recalling known information, even for complex tasks. No new abstractions, analogies, or learning occur during task execution. <strong>Examples:</strong>

            <strong>Very Low.</strong> The task involves minimal conceptualization, learning, inductive or analogical reasoning. It requires simple pattern identification or following basic instructions, with very limited generalization or basic surface-level analogies occurring during the task. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>

            <strong>Low.</strong> The task requires basic conceptualization, learning, inductive and analogical reasoning. It involves generalizing from a small set of examples, applying simple analogies to closely related domains, or applying simple instructions to new but closely related tasks. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>

            <li data-label="Level 3">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Intermediate.</strong> The task involves moderate conceptualization, learning, and inductive and analogical reasoning. It requires recognizing broader patterns, applying analogies across moderately different domains, and forming more complex hypotheses through analogical reasoning. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Reading passages where certain words are consistently replaced with nonsense words: &#x27;The zork lives in a tree. The small zork ate berries. Many zorks gather in winter [...]. The tired zork slept quietly&#x27;. Through the multiple examples, learning not just that &#x27;zork&#x27; likely means &#x27;squirrel&#x27;, but also understanding how it follows plural rules (&#x27;zorks&#x27;), can be modified by adjectives (&#x27;small zork&#x27;, &#x27;tired zork&#x27;), and performs actions typical of animals.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">While playing a strategy game named Xiangqi (also known as Chinese chess) without any prior experience on it, coming up with some effective tactics through repeated observations and trials as well as some past experience playing chess.</span></li>

Through systematic observation, forming basic hypotheses about how the sequence of environmental changes affects growth patterns.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <li data-label="Level 4">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>High.</strong> The task requires substantial conceptualization, inductive and analogical reasoning, and abstraction, involving the integration of multiple concepts, creating complex analogical mappings across diverse domains, and forming and testing complex hypotheses. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Working with a collection of text messages where response times vary significantly. Through analysis, discovering that certain word combinations, sentence structures, and punctuation patterns consistently correlate with faster or slower response times, then using these insights to predict likely response speeds for new messages.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">While learning Go after experience with chess and Xiangqi, discovering how stone formations serve multiple strategic purposes that differ fundamentally from piece-based games. Through systematic play and analysis, understanding how a group of stones can simultaneously secure territory, threaten invasion, and maintain connectivity with other groups. This requires substantial abstraction beyond piece-movement games to grasp how value emerges from stone relationships rather than individual pieces.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Working with a sequence of pattern acceptance tests where rules change systematically. For instance, in judging whether grid arrangements of colored shapes are &quot;valid&quot;: early patterns are accepted based on color adjacency (e.g., &quot;red must never touch blue&quot;), then the rule shifts to consider shape orientation (e.g., &quot;triangles must point toward squares&quot;), and finally combines both aspects (e.g., &quot;red triangles must point toward blue squares&quot;). The systematic nature of the rule changes follows a clear progression from simple single-attribute rules to combined rules. The subject must track these rule evolutions to correctly predict which new grid arrangements would be considered valid, understanding that rules become progressively more complex by combining previous attributes rather than introducing entirely new concepts.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <li data-label="Level 5+">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Very High.</strong> The task involves very advanced conceptualization, inductive and analogical reasoning, and abstraction. It requires generating new analogical frameworks in real-time, mapping relationships across highly diverse and abstract domains, or solving complex problems through novel analogical insights. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Solving a visual puzzle where three different properties (symmetry, rotation, and scaling) must be understood at both the element level and the pattern level. For instance, individual shapes follow one set of transformation rules, while the overall arrangement follows a different set of rules, and the relationship between these two rule sets must be discovered to predict the next state.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Designing a new electronic musical instrument after studying blueprints of synthesizers, amplifiers, and effect pedals. This requires abstracting core principles of signal generation, processing, and control from each device (oscillation, filtering, envelope shaping, feedback), understanding how these principles create different sonic characteristics, and then creatively recombining them to produce new types of sounds. The task demands identifying how fundamental concepts manifest differently across devices (like how feedback creates sustain in an amplifier but modulation in a ring modulator), then synthesizing these insights to create sound-generating mechanisms.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Working with a sequence of pattern acceptance tests where rules evolve with increasing abstraction and self-reference. Starting from &#x27;red triangles must point toward blue squares&#x27;, patterns evolve to where shapes establish relationships based on their relative properties. For instance, shapes with more sides must point toward shapes with fewer sides, but this relationship inverts when the shapes share colors. Furthermore, each valid pattern must mirror a small-scale arrangement within its larger structure - if three triangles form a particular relationship on one side of the grid, the overall shape arrangement of the entire grid must follow that same relationship. The subject must discover these nested self-referential patterns and predict how they apply at different scales, requiring both pattern recognition and the generation of new frameworks for understanding how rules can reference themselves.</span></li>

            <strong>Very low.</strong> Most relevant information is readily identifiable, with minimal extraneous details. The respondent needs to do simple filtering or selection of information as they proceed with solving the task, but the relevance of information remains clear throughout the process. <strong>Examples:</strong>

            <strong>Low.</strong> A fair amount of potentially relevant information is provided, mixed with some irrelevant details. As the respondent works through the problem, they need to evaluate which pieces of information are useful for the next step in their solution process, requiring ongoing but straightforward metacognitive assessment. <strong>Examples:</strong>

            <li data-label="Level 3">
          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Medium.</strong> The respondent must engage in moderate metacognitive processing throughout the problem-solving process in one or both of these ways: (1) evaluating and reconciling potentially conflicting or redundant information that serves as distractors within a manageable search space, or (2) recognizing what additional information or problem-solving approaches are needed when not all relevant information is explicitly provided, but the possible solution paths remain relatively constrained. Some information that seems irrelevant initially may become important later, or some unstated information may become crucial to identify as the solution progresses. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>

            <strong>High.</strong> The problem-solving process requires sophisticated metacognitive strategies throughout, with a large search space to navigate. This could involve either: (1) evaluating multiple possible interpretations of significant amounts of conflicting/redundant information that serves as distractors, requiring exploration of various combination possibilities, or (2) identifying crucial unstated information or approaches needed for solution while considering multiple possible solution paths and their implications. The respondent must frequently reassess their understanding and adjust their approach as they either discover new connections between provided information or recognize important unstated elements needed for solving the task. <strong>Examples:</strong>

        This criterion assesses the level of cognitive demands associated with mind modelling of others and social cognition. The level of cognitive demands progresses from tasks that require no mind modelling (specifically, the ability to model the minds of other agents) or social cognition to those that require reasoning about how the beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions of multiple other agents might interact to determine future behaviours.

            <strong>None.</strong> The task does not require mind modelling or social cognition. It may not involve other agents, or if it does, perceiving or interacting with those agents is not necessary to complete the task. <strong>Examples:</strong>

            <strong>Very low.</strong> Performance in this task is improved through the detection or recognition of other agents and by basic social learning (e.g., imitation). Critically, reasoning about observed behaviour or attributing mental states to others is not required for good performance in this task. <strong>Examples:</strong>

            <strong>Low.</strong> This task requires some basic intuition about the behaviour of others, but only minimal levels of mental state attribution. Good performance might be based on developing accurate associations between other’s responses and the stimuli that caused them. Note, this reasoning need not be explicit. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Intermediate.</strong> This task goes beyond simple state-behaviour associations and involves attributing cognitive or affective states (i.e., mentalising). That is, it involves inferring specific mental properties about others (‘they believe the moon landing was a hoax’, ‘they want a glass of water’). The task may not, however, require explicit reasoning about these mental states (i.e., full-blown theory of mind). <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>

                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Telling a colleague about a mutual friend&#x27;s new job, knowing they haven&#x27;t heard the news yet and thus might be interested.</span></li>

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>High.</strong> This task requires a full theory of mind to be solved effectively. It requires not only the attribution of mental states to others, but explicit reasoning about those states. It may also require the integration of social knowledge and heuristics about normal agentic behaviour to accurately predict future behaviour. Importantly, this task also requires a clear distinction between self- and other-related representations. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Developing an intuitive theory about an agent’s future behaviour such as understanding that Sally will look for her marble in the basket where she left it, even though Anne moved it to the box when Sally was away.</span></li>

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Very high.</strong> This task requires exceptional mind modelling and social cognition abilities. It goes beyond generating intuitive theories about another agent within a dyadic interaction, and instead requires the combination of multiple theories of mind corresponding to the intentions, emotions, and beliefs of a range of different agents. Expanding the scope of mind-modelling and social cognition to include multiple agents would enable more sophisticated forms of collaborative action. Tasks at this level may require an understanding of the complex networks and hierarchies that form within social groups. <strong>Examples:</strong>
          </span>

                        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Comprehending the plot of a romance novel or the ‘social drama’ at a dinner party that requires modelling the mental states of multiple agents (e.g., ‘I heard that Jane told Steve that his girlfriend Abigail wanted to leave, but that he didn’t believe her, thinking Jane was just causing trouble because she had seen Abigail talking to her boyfriend Andrew…’)</span></li>

      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        This rubric evaluates the logical reasoning demands of tasks across six levels of difficulty, focusing exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is required whenever a task involves matching and applying rules, procedures, or algorithms to solve problems, making structured decisions based on given premises, or deriving conclusions through systematic steps. This includes tasks ranging from basic arithmetic operations to sophisticated multi-step problem solving that requires careful chaining of logical relationships. Each level increases in complexity based on the intricacy of logical constructs, the depth of reasoning required, the number of premises involved, and the abstraction of concepts.

        This rubric assesses the complexity of spatial and physical understanding and reasoning required by a task. More specifically, the level represents the extent to which the task requires understanding spatial relationships between objects and predicting physical interactions, ranging from simple recognition of static relationships to complex mental manipulations involving multiple objects, transformations, and physical predictions across different dimensions. Notably, this should focus on the minimum way of solving the task since many tasks do not actually require spatio-physical reasoning to be successfully solved, even though spatio-physical reasoning may help.

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Intermediate.</strong> Tasks require coordinating multiple spatial relationships and performing sequential transformations. Mental models need to be constructed, involving intermediate levels of both physical prediction and spatial reasoning (3D reasoning or multiple steps in a 2D space), but focussing on the spatial. <strong>Examples:</strong>

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>High.</strong> Tasks involve complex spatial transformations and integration of multiple spatial operations. Requires construction and manipulation of mental models, often involving prediction of outcomes of non-trivial spatial transformations. <strong>Examples:</strong>

          <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <strong>Very High.</strong> Tasks require very advanced spatial reasoning involving multiple simultaneous transformations and the prediction of highly complex spatial outcomes. These tasks involve predicting intricate chains of physical interactions and visualizing sophisticated spatial relationships that evolve over time or through multiple steps. <strong>Examples:</strong>

        The following rubric is designed to annotate the conceptual sophistication level of tasks based entirely on the depth of knowledge or conceptual understanding required in the fields of applied sciences and professions (e.g., medicine, law, education, business, agriculture, engineering except software and data engineering). Noteworthy, this rubric only focuses on applied knowledge and practical implementations rather than purely theoretical frameworks or abstract concepts from natural sciences, formal sciences, social sciences and humanities. For instance, understanding chemical reactions is only part of natural sciences, but applying this knowledge in pharmaceutical manufacturing would fall under applied sciences. Similarly, economic theory belongs only to social sciences, but practical business management and operations fall under applied sciences and professions. The focus is exclusively on the level of domain-specific knowledge needed, disregarding other cognitive demands such as reasoning or metacognition. This reflects only the depth of applied sciences and professional knowledge required.

        The following rubric is designed to annotate the conceptual sophistication level of tasks based strictly on the depth of knowledge or conceptual understanding required in the fields of formal sciences (e.g., mathematics, logic, computer science, statistics). This does not include natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, earth sciences, ecology) or social sciences and humanities (e.g., history, psychology, sociology, anthropology, literature, art, philosophy, linguistics). It&#x27;s crucial to understand that this rubric measures only the level of formal scientific knowledge needed, not considering other cognitive demands such as reasoning or metacognition. This indicates solely the depth of formal sciences knowledge required.

        This rubric defines a scale that evaluates tasks based on how unlikely they appear in various sources (internet, textbooks, tests) and how unlikely the specific instance is to have been previously encountered and memorized. The scale ranges from exactly identical instances that are widely known to completely novel task formulations, focusing on the uniqueness of both the task type and the specific instance rather than its difficulty or complexity.

            <strong>None.</strong> The task is a staple one. Exactly the same instance of the task appears many times on the Internet, textbooks or common psychological or achievement tests, and the solution is generally well-known and memorized. <strong>Examples:</strong>

      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        This rubric defines a scale that evaluates the task purely based on its *volume*, i.e., the time a fully competent, experienced and motivated human would need to both read and complete the task in ideal conditions, not counting breaks or interruptions, regardless of the difficulty or cognitive demands of the task. The scale ranges from tasks requiring less than a second to those requiring more than 16 hours (1,000 minutes), focusing purely on volume of work rather than cognitive complexity or skill requirements. Time estimates assume the task performer has all necessary information, tools, and skills readily available, but works autonomously without the assistance of other humans or AI tools.

                    By testing a LLM on the ADeLe benchmark, an ability "profile" can be extracted, representing an
                    ability
                    level for each considered dimension. The plot below
                    shows the profile of the LLMs considered in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378">the original
                    paper</a>.

                <p>
                    From the annotated ADeLe battery and the instance-level results of a LLM, the ability value for
                    each dimension is obtained by:
                <ol>
                    <li> plotting the success probability
                        of the
                        LLM at increasing demand levels (<em>characteristic curve</em>).
                        A dominant strategy is used to remove confounders:
                        at any demand level, only instances of ADeLe where
                        all other dimensions have demand lower than that of the considered dimension are kept.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ability score is then defined as the x-value where a logistic fit is at 0.5.
                    </li>
                </ol>
